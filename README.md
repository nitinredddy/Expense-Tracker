# Expense Tracker  

This is my **Expense Tracker Project**.  
I made it using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  

---

## What it does  
- You can add **income** and **expenses**.  
- It shows the **balance** at the top.  
- All transactions show up in a list.  
- You can **delete** a transaction if you want.  
- It **saves data** in the browser, so even if you refresh it doesn’t go away.

## Files  
- `index.html` → the main page  
- `style.css` → design and colors  
- `script.js` → all the logic and functions  

---

## How to run  
1. Download the folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Start adding transactions.
